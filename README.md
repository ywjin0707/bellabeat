### Scenario
Bellabeat was founded in 2013 by Urška Sršen and Sando Mur as a manufacturing company for smart tech products with focus on women's health. By 2016, Bellbeat had successfully launched multiple products to empower women with information about their own health. 
As a junior data analyst in the marketing analyst team at Bellabeat, I am tasked with analyzing smart device usage data to gain insight on user behaviour to discover opportunities for growth and guide marketing strategies.
